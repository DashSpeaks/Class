We've kept the aesthetic from 1957 when it became ""The Parkside Lounge.""  The space reeks of real New York but the maintenance is nonstop. The infrastructure is constantly needing repair.  It's costly and dangerous.  I've learned it's the price of doing business as a steward of a place like the Parkside but when there's no business the building costs quickly spiral out of control.","The Parkside has always been a safe space for performers of all backgrounds. In addition to the live music that we book, we have a long list of LGBTQIA burlesque performing groups that have made the Parkside their home for years. We also host arguably one of the most ethnically diverse variety shows in the area with The Inspired Word.  Most importantly, we're involved with the local Latinx community of the LES - we host fundraisers, memorials, weddings, showers, and everything else!","The Parkside is a small mom and pop venue.  We've always been inclusive in our staffing and have an undeniable track record of hiring a racially diverse crew that challenges the traditional gender roles in our industry. All are paid equally. Positions of leadership in the nightlife industry were grossly male dominated in my experience working in NYC over the past 3 decades. Here we've consistently filled the position of GM, the closest we have to an executive, with women, often BIPOC.",60,20,"We put our money where our mouth is. Our business model is built around booking acts who draw crowds that embrace inclusivity of all humans.  We don't tolerate any type of bias and have 20 years of performances that show how important our stage is to the diverse community that is New York City.  Every artist deserves a safe space to share their craft no matter their gender identity, ethnicity, or sexual preference.  We've been lucky to have so many of them call our stage home.",We were a venue here on the Lower East Side long before Ludlow street was a destination and our stage was a huge part of the indie rock scene that exploded nationwide when bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Lady Gaga blew the doors off the place. We've provided a space for smaller acts that haven't built their following up for larger venues and have helped build careers and economies not just local to the LES. We're also always the first to donate our space to fundraisers when disaster strikes.,"The Parkside's neon has been called a beacon by New Yorkers for countless different reasons. To most it represents a side of New York City that has rapidly been fading.  Sadly this was true even before Covid. 

Now more than ever, New York needs businesses like us that defy the corporate takeover taking place. The Parkside is not just an old venue on the corner of Houston & Attorney. We're a community of musicians, writers, bartenders, stock brokers, chefs, comedians, artists, and every other profession that came together every night for over 20 years.  Now, with our industry decimated, we risk losing this most vibrant aspect of The City. The Parkside is the most genuine example of true New York I've encountered to this day: whether we were mobbed with happy neighbors when the lights came back on in the LES after hurricane Sandy, raising funds for tenants in the aftermath of the 2nd Avenue explosion, closing out a surprisingly successful 10 month run of a Sci-fi musical,  loading in the 6 bands on the bill that night, or watching a drag queen school the local pool team captain in billiards (in 6 inch heels!!), The Parkside embodies the very spirit of the City we love. 

It is weird.  It is wild. It is wonderful.              

This grant will be vital in allowing us to keep the lights on and our staff employed.  Our community depends on us as a cultural hub of New York City where audiences can come together.  Your grant will help us weather this storm so that when it's safe to do so we can once again be an outlet for the creative energy bursting out from our collective experiences during this crazy year.

Our performance calendar loudly proclaims that we are a space that amplifies the voices of black, brown, indigenous peoples, of gay, bi trans.

In the span of a week, an incredible diversity of communities is represented.","Before Covid, we were able to bring together diverse communities merging scenes that didn't previously have a space to connect. For example, we'd present jazz music on the same night as a BIPOC/LGBT -led dance party bringing a communities together and allowing them to be enriched by each other. The diversity of our programming, the ways in which we brought disparate communities together was probably our greatest contribution to the NY nightlife scene.","It would help us to continue our mission of fostering a local music and arts scene, of finding emerging artists and giving them a platform to express themselves. In our short tenure we've worked with the Afropunk festival, FADER Magazine, hosted artists ranging from Alicia Keys to Bushwick favorites Native Suns, Queer Cosplay party Sailor Boom to Avant garde jazz composer John Zorn, and too many others to name.

Because my gear is mostly custom made LED lighting fixtures, they are nearly impossible to resell but are very valuable to me in my work. This is the primary reason I'm reaching out for assistance.","My lighting design work started when I began donating lighting design services to the Melting Point charity rave for about 4 months. Melting Point is a party that raises money for Al Otro Lado, an organization that provides legal support to immigrants seeking asylum at the US/Mexico border. From this work I started taking on paid clients but continue donating services to charity events and provide discounts to marginalized promoters. I have only ever hired BIPOC and/or LGTBQ+ assistants.","I try to provide opportunities to people who genuinely want to learn more about lighting design and work within the nightlife scene, this is and always will be my primary consideration.

My work is inseparable from these values.","I think I came up with some pretty cool and impactful lighting designs over the last few years. After just four months of working as a lighting designer I was responsible for designing a stage at a 3,500+ person warehouse party and regularly see 300-1200 people at the events we do. Most importantly, because I'm not a large unionized lighting house I am able to provide these services at much more fair and reasonable prices for the people making it much more accessible.",It would allow me to continue doing this work and especially would allow me to continue hiring others to help me.

Most of my headliners in 2019 were queer women of color, and we have always paid our artists much more than the usual NYC DJ rate, and much, much more my partner and I ever take home from a show. As a business we break even each concert, because it's about the community & the experience, never the profit. As a studio, my doors are always open to everyone.","Booking predominance for Sweatshop (an event under Arrowhead House) is always BIPOC & LGBTQ.  As a party that celebrates afrobeat, reggaeton, dancehall and countless other world musical cultures, it has always been our duty to be authentic in our message through our bookings and performances. Pay is always equal across the board, and there have never been or will never be ANY limitations on anything related to gender or race. It would go against everything I believe in a part of this community.",80,50,"Through the celebration of individuality through artistic expression that is never limited by corporate pressures of any kind, any expectations or quotas, or any practices that fail to embrace diversity in the same way I do in my everyday life. Through social campaigns, themed events & fundraisers for local causes, and especially by working with the community to create safe spaces for every walk of life. Looking to the future, we plan on upholding these same values as we work with the youth.","In 2019, Sweatshop (an Arrowhead House production) saw more attendance than any other similar party in all over NYC. Between 2019 & 2020, 80% of our lineups (including performers, dancers, djs, and instrumentalists) were BIOPIC, and 60% were LGBTQ. Our lineup quality & concert experience grew exponentially over the last 3 years, but we've never changed the ticket price. Every event is $10. Our events are accessible to everyone, and a true celebration of the NYC melting pot.","It would allow us to promote virtual events for our artists while allowing us to pay them as if we would a live show. It would allow my recording studio business to keep the lights on so it can continue providing the Bed Stuy community with safe creative space. It would allow me to fund my after school programs for youthful musicians, and it would allow me to save everything Ive built the last 8 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-09-15 17:00:32

In my professional community, I’ve worked towards building a more inclusive and diverse staff, actively looking for BIPOC/LGBTQIA engineers to train and hire. I also help to weed out toxic masculinity from the culture of NYC live music, through promoting respect and calling out problematic behavior.","I’ve run sound for thousands of successful events that have all fed the vitality that makes NYC nightlife special. My work behind the scenes ensures that everybody involved has a night of top-tier sound and comfort.

I’ve also contributed to the diversity and safety of the professional sound community by helping remove toxic people and replacing them with a variety of positive contributors, at Baby's and beyond. Lastly, I've successfully fought for wage increases for all sound staff at my job.","If I can still afford to be around when reopening finally happens, I fully intend to continue my work of providing quality experiences and building a more inclusive live sound ecosystem in NYC. 

The federal stimulus helped me get through the summer with some savings, but now that it's expired, waiting around in NYC until venues reopen is becoming financially harder to see. 

Receiving this grant will help me cover my rent and bills for another month, and stretch out my timeline to where I might still be able to stick it out for reopening or further stimulus, without trying to start a new career somewhere cheaper!",2020-09-15 20:42:47

This show— a incredible burlesque ballet production, is also a deeply touching story about humanity. About human nature and how life is only now. Anyone who experiences this show is inspired, and feels the deeper message of how precious this life we have is. I am so grateful to be apart of this story and this is company to spread such a meaningful message in an incredible way.","I rent rehearsal space often from The Woods, which is a small rehearsal space in Bushwick. They are having fears of having to close due to COVID. This is the only studio space I have been able to find since the pandemic and I am SO grateful to them. I would be able to book enough space to not only rehearse but to keep this hidden bushwick gem alive and running during a time where many studios are closing indefinitely.

This is something I have been trying to incorporate in every aspect of my career demonstrated by the not-for-profit that I co-founded in Australia that seeks to empower women and LGBTQIA communities.","As a female POC who emigrated to America, I have learnt first hand the challenges minority groups face in the nightlife community both in New York and globally. I am an active advocate for equality. My not-for-profit, One of One, that I co-founded, is working to disrupt the music industry to make it a more inclusive environment for future generations of women and LGBTQIA.

To see the live music scene shutdown with no end in sight is completely heartbreaking. However, the silver lining of my forced unemployment due to the pandemic has been the extra time I have been able to dedicate pro-bono, to my not-for-profit.

The grant would allow me to focus completely/wholeheartedly on my not-for profit.

I always maintain a good balance of gender in my crews and believe I have worked to make a difference in Nyc Nightlife.","If I could receive grant assistance, it would allow me to stabilize my monetary situation which would free me up to work with artists at a discounted rate, or even free, if I felt it was the right thing to do, on post production mixing and audio until the shutdown has ended and we can all return to bringing concerts to the people. Depending on the funding amount, I could finish my home recording studio which would allow me to grow as an independent contractor and studio engineer and those skills will benefit my artist community as a whole for years to come.",2020-09-15 20:43:24

I was working about  4-5 nights a week working as box office, bartender, and fire guard at Knitting Factory as well as one day a week doing marketing work. 

My degree is in theater production and my past work experience is theater, music venues, and record labels. Live performances can't happen and labels are on a hiring freeze so the job search hasn't been successful.",Yes,No,No,"While working I always actively observe people and make note of when I think marginalized peoples aren't being treated fairly and report it to a supervisor.
For example, I was once working box office at a job and one of the security guards made a transphobic comment in regards to gendered bathrooms. I told him that it wasn't cool and also reported it to my supervisor who addressed the situation. 
I also call out the booking team when a bill is all male or all white. I think we are all over that","The first way is kindness. I am welcoming at work. I go and support other artists and workers at different venues and shows. 

I had a radio show pre-COVID and about a decent amount of people following me so when a venue or a band is revealed to be harmful to the community, I speak out with my platforms. For example, when it was revealed one of Elsewhere's investors was a predator, I made sure people in my community were aware. I think talking about the difficult things are the best way to bring awareness.

At bars when I see dudes being creepy, I try to make sure the other people are okay. I've helped drunk people get into cabs home. It all starts with kindness and safety.","I bring a lot of positivity to my job. At Knitting Factory, I worked to boost staff morale with staff parties, a book club, and memes in the staff bathroom. I think a positive staff brings a positive customer experience. Especially once it hits 2:30am and we have to push through. 
I also helped start Trivia Night at the Knit which brought a new audience to our venue.","Right now I am at a point where I'm interviewing for a jobs I don't want and wouldn't be useful for me. I love working in nightlife and I think the nightlife world loves me. I really don't want to be stuck at a remote office job that I accepted in COVID. I want to be in the venue when it opens up. 

I'm using this time to study the live music ecosystem and figure out how we can rebuild in a more efficient way for the artists and the venues. And how we can be more inclusive. I also want to figure out the best practices for reopening. How do we ensure safety for staff and customers if we open before a vaccine? I'm very interested in researching that.

A grant to allow me to do that with my time would be super cool and then I'd be ready to apply what I've learned when we reopen.",2020-09-16 04:25:08

If we continue to amplify marginalized voices by sharing music and booking helping produce events run by members of those communities then it will seem less of an marginalized community and more of an integral part of the NYC nightlife to the greater public, even though we in the industry know diversity is what makes our scene amazing. I treat BIPOC and LGBTQIA producers and artists like members of our venue's family and that's why the keep coming back and feel so safe. Fighting for their rights as performers and human beings with high visibility, using our venue's socials and contacts, is the least we can do in this industry.","I think that I have made every performer that has ever come through any door of any venue I've worked at feel treated with respect. Whether they are a staple of NYC's scene, a large touring act passing through, or a smaller artist or band trying to make a name for themselves outside of their hometown, it gives me comfort to know that I did everything I possibly could to make them think fondly of their experience performing in New York.

I will continue to commit to meeting the moment & pivoting towards helping marginalized communities.","The nightlife industry is certainly not easy to work in -- not for the faint of heart. I've DJ'd at venues at the beginning of my career that I learned were basically racist or homophobic with their door policies. I try to avoid working with particular establishments that have strict door policies because that left a bad taste in my mouth. I want to only work events together with entities that accept people from all walks of life and have energized communities -- beautiful spirits that let loose on the dancefloor without judgment. As an artist/DJ/performer it is incredibly important to save these particular spaces that many of these communities call home. It is a beautiful thing and I will always stand for what's morally right, call out and defend when I see someone mistreated, and elevate voices that need it most.

I lead a collective of producers, rappers, artists, & dancers that make music which fuses house music & hip hop. The aesthetic surrounding the music involves graffiti art & dance. House music at its roots was a scene that took in marginalized communities when no one else would. Both house and hip hop are historically black. Fusing worlds & genres opens up one's mind & creates collaboration.","After using some of the grant money for living expenses, I would be able to use some of the money towards throwing more events (post-covid) involving artists that need their voices heard most. I work with all types of artists and music genres so I just want to be able to piece it altogether and create a platform for more artists to perform and create.

I frequently attend parties, event, raves, what have you, at places that I know share the same values (Mood Ring, Nowadays, Sustain-Release, Bossa Nova). Simply put, I try to stay clear of spaces that lack diversity and could potentially have even a modicum of toxic masculinity. I can't cut the latter out of my life completely, but I certainly know how to avoid it within my local nightlife community.","Again, this is difficult to answer for me. I'm not a business owner or a person of influence, so I'm not sure if I had any impact, positive or negative. I guess I just try to foster a positive, progressive environment around me by being a regular at establishments that I know are inclusive safe spaces and surrounding myself  in said space with those who share the same core values.
